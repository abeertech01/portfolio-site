          Hello, My name is Abdul Ahad (happy to be called 'Abeer'), a
          JavaScript Developer from Dhaka, Bangladesh ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©. I started coding in
          2017 with Java right after finishing my 12th grade exam. But I
          couldn't keep up with the complexity of Java and started exploring
          JavaScript and the web development world. It has been almost 5 years
          since I started exloring the web development and I am loving every bit
          of time with JavaScript. But for more than 2 years as of now I have
          done a lot of professional work. Since I have been in this field for
          quite a lot of time I have developed the sense of development and what
          works in the market and what not. <br />
          <br />
          Nowadays I am more focused on TypeScript and NextJS or overall the
          entire React-ecosystem. I am also focusing a lot on networking and my
          online presence. By the way, I am very much active on Twitter/X. You
          can follow me{" "}
