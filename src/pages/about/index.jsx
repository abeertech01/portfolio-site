        <p>
          Hello, My name is Abdul Ahad (you can call me &apos;Abeer&apos;), a
          JavaScript Developer from Dhaka, Bangladesh ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©. I started coding in
          2017 with Java to explore programming in general. After spending some
          time with Java and Android Development I got interest in web
          development while exploring the JavaScript World. Since 2021, I am
          working as a professional JavaScript Developer. I started coding with
          Vue framework but ended up loving the React Realm and MERN stack.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />I have worked on some freelance projects in 2021. From 2022,{" "}
          <span className="text-yellow-300">
            I started working at a startup called MoonHoldings, founded by{" "}

            . I handled the Frontend with Vue and NextJS, Backend with ExpressJS
            and Firebase mostly.

          I worked at the startup for a year and it was a great experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          Nowadays I am more focused on TypeScript and NextJS or overall the
          entire React-ecosystem. I am also focusing a lot on networking and my
          online presence. By the way, I am trying to be regularly active on
          Twitter/X. You can follow me here{" "}
